A cake with a lit candle,
Presents with ribbons and bows,
A bike with pink, glittery1 handles,
A little girl who grows and grows.
 
What will you wish for, my love,
On this, your very special day?
Send your wish to God above.
It will come true if you pray.
 
As you blow out the candle, my dear,
I'll make a wish for you too.
I'll whisper it so you won't hear,
That way I know it will come true.
 
My wish for you is like sunshine,
Warm, cheery, and full of delight,
My wish is the starlight, soothing2 and fine,
Which lights up the dark, dreary3 night.
 
May God follow you always,
May the path always be clear,
And may you have a happy birthday
This day and all through the years.
